# Technical test 5 created by Iris Paredes.

# Description and specifications.

Our favorite market has a new service in which every day we can order a dish and we can place an order with the ingredients, today we play Vegan Mushroom Risotto.

With the data provided by the market, we will use a facilitated JSON file, which includes the ingredients of the mushroom risotto recipe. We have to make a small front with the name of the dish, and the list to buy the ingredients taking into account that:

I will be able to select all the ingredients, one or none
I will be able to change the quantity of an item.

I will always have an up-to-date list of what it would cost me to place an order (in case of having selected items).

The purchase button will always mark that amount.

The purchase button should take you to the final purchase url, but that will be left for another day.

We will not use React in this case, but we will use Bootstrap.
